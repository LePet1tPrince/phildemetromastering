Welcome:

Welcome to Phil Demetro Mastering!
Thank you for visiting.

About:

Formally a senior Mastering Engineer at the prestigious Lacquer Channel, in Toronto, I have 2 decades+ of mastering experience and have worked on 10000's of projects.  I have recently struck out on my own with the intention of serving my clients more efficiently while staying within your budget.


Approach:

Years of ongoing critical listening tests of every aspect of a modern studio has culminated in assembling the best audio signal path that I am aware of anywhere in the world. From 240V power to custom cabling to proprietary gear modifications All of these elements ensure the lowest noise floor to make room for the maximum delivery of a musical signal.

Mastering Equipment:

Analog: Sontec, Neumann, Focusrite, Manley, Neve, Meyer Sound, Dangerous Music, Rupert Neve Designs
Workstation: Sequoia, Wavelab
Digital: Lavry, RME, Weiss, Z-Sys
Playback: HEDDphones, PSB, Sennheiser
Plugins from CubeTec, MDW, Apogee, FabFilter, UAD, Waves, Izotope, etc...

MY passion is mastering and thanks to a never ending steam of client feedback my skillset is constantly evolving and improving... always fresh and competitive. You will sound well placed and fit naturally in the context of any streaming mix.
